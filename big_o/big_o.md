# Big O

- Time Complexity
- Space Complexity

## O(1)

-> Optimal
-> constant running time complexity
-> These algorithms are the fastest approaches: the running time is independent of the N input (number of items)

## O (log n)

-> Divide and Conquer
-> Logarithmic running time complexity
-> These algorithms' running time scale logarithmically with the N input
-> so the running time increases logarithmically with the size of the input

## O(n)

-> Proportional
-> Drop Constant
-> Linear running time complexity
-> These algorithms' running time scale linearly with the N input
-> so the running time increases linearly with the size of the input

## O(nÂ²)

- Drop non-dominant
- Loop between a loop
