Asymptotic Complexity
"""


"""
Finding the complexity of an algorithm
- Ignore non-dominant terms
- Ignore constants
- Simple variable assignments, arithmetic operations
    and comparions are usually constant time operations
- Simple loops over the input are running in liear time
- Simple loops over the input are running in quadratic time
- Logaritmic time happens when we disregard large parts
    of the input with each loop
